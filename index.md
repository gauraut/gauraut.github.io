<a>Creating a panorama using traditional and deep learning approach</a> 
<br><br>
<img src="images/p2.png?raw=true"/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>• Implemented an API which takes input a list of images and outputs a stitched panorama using
Python and OpenCV
• Designed and developed Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS), feature descriptor
and feature extraction, RANSAC for outlier rejection and homography estimation modules,
all from scratch
• Implemented the warping and image blending algorithm from scratch
• Implemented and trained an API which estimates homographic relation between images
using Homography Net.
• Programmed the network using PyTorch and trained in both supervised and unsupervised manner</p>

<a>Texture and intensity based edge detection algorithm (Pb-lite)</a> 
<br><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>• Implemented an API to detect edge using the probability of boundary edge detection
algorithm and programmed using OpenCV and Python
• Designed and used custom made DOG, Leung-Malik and Gabor filter banks from scratch
• Implemented K-Means for Texture, Brightness and Color maps and computed their gradients
using the above designed filter banks
• Produced edge detection results which were better than the traditional Sobel and Canny
benchmark and were also closer to the ground truth</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>GAS collection robot is used to fetch the objects in large warehouses.The robot autonomously searches for the object using path planning algorithm.It uses camera to detect the object and aligns itself in the direction of the object.Once it has found the object it returns to to the billing station to return the object.</p>

<br><br>
<img src="images/rover.jpeg?raw=true"/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ROS package for Mars Rover equipped with a 5DOF arm to pick and place debris on Mars.It has a camera and lidar sensor mounted on it which helps in navigation and to avoid obstacle.</p>

<br><br>
<img src="images/human.gif?raw=true"/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Detection of humans in standing position.The module is developed using HOG+SVM algorithm.Non Max Suppression is used to remove the overlapping detection boxes.The module is developed in C++  using OOPs concepts.</p>
